# Kola canopy analystics tool

Kola is an image analystics tool developed to identify the certain crop properties. This is stand alone web application which calculates following fucntionalities.

 - Canopy cover
 - Crop coeffecient 
 - ETo (short (grass) reference evapotranspiration(mm, mm d−1))
 - ETc (crop evapotranspiration (mm, mm d−1))


# How to use the app
