# Kola canopy analystics tool

Kola is an image analystics tool developed to identify the certain crop properties. This is stand alone web application which calculates following fucntionalities.

 - Canopy cover
 - Crop Coeffecient 
 - ETo (short (grass) reference evapotranspiration(mm, mm d−1))
 - ETc (crop evapotranspiration (mm, mm d−1))


# How to use the app

  - Use the app link provided [click](https://dishan3x.github.io/canopeo_analytics_tool/).
  - Open the camera and point over the canopy area over the ground 1m away from  ground.
  - Take the picture and see the results.

# Browser recommendation
